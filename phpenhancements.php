                    <h2>Responsive design</h2>
                    <p>The goal of responsive web design is to create web pages using HTML and CSS that appear nice on all devices such as desktops, tablets, and phones. A responsive web design will adapt to changing screen sizes and viewports automatically.</p>
                    <p>Required code: </p>
                    <p>In HTML, to make responsive website, developer need to use &lt;meta&gt; tag with name \"viewport\" and set initial-scale with 1.0</p>
                    <p>In CSS, for each viewports such developers need to build specific CSS selecters and property for each view port such as for tablet and smart phone the font size would be smaller and the content would be arranged to be a column instead of a row.
                        Using \"@media\" property and a specific max-width(size of viewport) for different viewports.
                    </p>
                    <p>In CSS, there are also grid and flow properties to manage reponsive design (divide a block to mutilple column and resize that with different viewports automatically)</p>
                    <p>For the small devices such as Mobile Phones and Tablets, we created a <strong>Hamburger menu</strong> as an innovation <em>without using JavaScript</em>, we used the <strong> :checked pseudo element </strong> in css and html as checkbox to make the menu visible when it is clicked.</p>

                    <h2>Animation</h2>
                    <p><strong>This is an Advance CSS</strong></p>
                    <p>An animation allows an element to transition from one style to another gradually. To utilise CSS animation, you must first define the animation's keyframes. Keyframes define the styles that an element will have at different points in time.</p>
                    <p>In CSS,there is a property called \"@keyframe\" to implement the animation spin the logo made by CSS 360 degree with a same speed from beginning to the end infinitely.
                    </p>
                    <p>In that logo, developer need to put an animation element (roll), so the element could know which animation it have to implement and how long it must occur.</p>
